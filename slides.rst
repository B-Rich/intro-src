* Numpy and IPython
* Commercial support

What do Scientists need?
------------------------

* Rapid prototyping
* Fast numerics
* Good visualization
* Domain specific libraries
* Code that can be shared

**You want to do science, publish papers, and not futz about with code!**

Alternatives
------------

* C/C++
* Julia

Why this course?
----------------

   \begin{quote}
  Because computing is now an integral part of every aspect of science, but
  most scientists are never taught how to build, use, validate, and share
  software well. As a result, many spend hours or days doing things badly that
  could be done well in just a few minutes. Our goal is to change that so that
  scientists can spend less time wrestling with software and more time doing
  useful research.
